# Lite Launcher

The Lite Launcher is a framework for Fabric & Forge which loads the latest Lite version
during the runtime environment.

The Lite Launcher downloads the same version as CurseForge:

## Compatibility

We are compatible with the following versions & environments:

**Forge:**

**Fabric:**

## Information

The Lite Launcher environment cannot be used during a dev environment via IntelliJ or
Eclipse because the Lite code is decompiled. Accordingly, you would have to compile your
mod and then put it in the `.minecraft/mods` folder to see the Lite environment in the
game.
